The Game Hardware Survey
========================
The aggregated Game Hardware Survey data is generated by `summarize_json.ipynb`.

Report Format
-------------
The aggregation job produces a JSON file that contains an array of objects, each one containing the aggregated data for a single week (_week objects_). The `date` property indicates the first day of the week the aggregated data refers to.

Each property name in a week object encodes the name of a dimension over which the data was aggregated, together with the value used for the aggregation i.e. `dimension_value`. The numeric property value represents the proportion (or _ratio_) of users within the aggregation group, for that particular dimension and value.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "dim_val1": 0.5,
    "dim_val2": 0.5,
    "date": "2016-05-01",
  },
  {
    "dim_val1": 0.2,
    "dim_val2": 0.8,
    "date": "2016-05-08",
  },
]
```

The second week object tells that 20% of the users reported `val1` for `dim` and 80% reported `val2` for `dim`, for the week starting on the 8th of May, 2016.

Reported Data
-------------
The following is a list of the reported dimensions for the aggregated data:

* `browserArch`: the architecture of the browser, either `x86` or `x86-64`.
* `cpuCores`: the number of CPU cores.
* `cpuVendor`: the name of the CPU vendor.
* `cpuSpeed`: the speed of the CPU in GHz, rounded to the first decimal number.
* `cpuCoresSpeed`: the number of cores aggregated with the speed of the CPU in GHz, rounded to the first decimal number.
* `gpuVendor`: the name of the vendor for the main video card.
* `gpuModel`: the model for the main video card, derived from the reported vendor and device identifiers.
* `resolution`: the resolution of the main screen, as a "WIDTHxHEIGHT" string. The width can be prefixed with a `~`, indicating that the resolution was rounded to the nearest hundredth.
* `ram`: the amount of installed RAM memory, in Gb.
* `osName`: the name and version of the installed Operating System.
* `osArch`: the architecture of the Operating System, either `x86` or `x86-64`.
* `hasFlash`: either `True` or `False`, depending on whether or not the Flash plugin is present.

**Example**
```json
[
  {
    "browserArch_x86": 0.6,
    "browserArch_x86-64": 0.4,
    "cpuCores_1": 0.1,
    "cpuCores_2": 0.4,
    "cpuCores_4": 0.2,
    "cpuCores_Other": 0.3,
    "date": "2016-05-01",
  },
]
```

Means that 60% of the reference user population reported the use of Firefox x86 while 40% reported the use of Firefox x86-64. The reported number of CPU cores are a bit more fragmented: 10% report 1 core, 40% 2 cores and 20% 4 cores. Moreover, 30% of the users report a less common number of cores, so they are grouped together in the "Other" bucket.

Changelog
---------

* 6ea4922162eddd85d890f18a2538d5edc18b8039 - Renamed the data points to use the camelCase (e.g. *os_arch_* becomes *osArch_*);
